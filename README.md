# literature

To help validate the pyrolysis models, comparisons were made with results from literature. Each folder (listed below) in this repository contains code examples which utilize formulas or theories proposed in literature. These examples were compared to results or figures in the paper and later applied to other models. References are also listed in the comments of each code file.

## Blasi2003
Correlation for devolatilization time as tv where tv = time for 95% conversion. Based on Equation 2 and Figure 12 in the paper.

nitrogen." Energy & fuels 17.1 (2003): 247-254.

## Churchill1974
Correlations from section "Functions Which Cross One Limiting Solution". Plots should be same as in Figures 9 and 10 on page 41.
